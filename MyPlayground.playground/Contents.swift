//Structs are used almost everywhere in Swift: String, Int, Double, Array and even Bool are all implemented as structs, and now you can recognize that a function such as isMultiple(of:) is really a method belonging to Int.
//
//Let’s recap what else we learned:
//
//You can create your own structs by writing struct, giving it a name, then placing the struct’s code inside braces.
//Structs can have variable and constants (known as properties) and functions (known as methods)
//If a method tries to modify properties of its struct, you must mark it as mutating.
//You can store properties in memory, or create computed properties that calculate a value every time they are accessed.
//We can attach didSet and willSet property observers to properties inside a struct, which is helpful when we need to be sure that some code is always executed when the property changes.
//Initializers are a bit like specialized functions, and Swift generates one for all structs using their property names.
//You can create your own custom initializers if you want, but you must always make sure all properties in your struct have a value by the time the initializer finishes, and before you call any other methods.
//We can use access to mark any properties and methods as being available or unavailable externally, as needed.
//It’s possible to attach a property or methods directly to a struct, so you can use them without creating an instance of the struct.
